The Greek historian knew what he was talking about. The Longest River the Nile is 4,160 miles long—the world’s longest river. It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. In the south the Nile churns with cataracts. A cataract is a waterfall. A delta is an area near a river’s mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. The floods deposited rich soil along the Nile’s shores. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. Red Land, Black Land The ancient Egyptians lived in narrow bands of land on each side of the Nile. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. The four months of winter were sunny but cooler. Most of the region received only an inch of rain a year. The parts of Egypt not near the Nile were a desert. The Mediterranean coast was swampy and lacked good harbors. For these reasons, early Egyptians stayed close to home. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. Working together, they dug irrigation canals that carried river water to dry areas. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. Fruits included dates, figs, grapes, and watermelons. They were the first to weave fibers from flax plants into a fabric called linen. Lightweight linen cloth was perfect for hot Egyptian days. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. They wove sticks and palm trees to make roofs. Inside, woven reed mats covered the dirt floor. Most Egyptians slept on mats covered with linen sheets. Wealthy citizens enjoyed bed frames and cushions. Some had a pool filled with lotus blossoms and fish. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. They often cooked, ate, and even slept outside. Egypt’s economy depended on farming. The Egyptians wanted valuable metals that were not found in the black land. For example, they wanted copper to make tools and weapons. Ancient Egyptians also desired gold for its bright beauty. Nubia was the Egyptian name for the area of the upper Nile that had the richest gold mines in Africa. The Egyptians also mined lapis lazuli. These beautiful blue stones were used in jewelry. To go on the river, Egyptians made lightweight rafts by binding together reeds. They used everything from nets to harpoons to catch fish. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. Egyptians also captured quail with nets. They used boomerangs to knock down flying ducks and geese. ( A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) The Nile then became a highway. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. They began to trade with each other. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This method of trade is called bartering. Egypt prospered along the Nile. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. Other artisans made pottery, incense, mats, furniture, linen clothing, sandals, or jewelry. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. As Egypt grew, so did its need to organize. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces .
